Dynamite Valley
===============

It's fall, and that means it's blasting season!

The beavers here in Dynamite Valley Park have been
working overtime, making dams!  If I've told you
once, Ranger Jim, I've told you a thousand times--
now get out there and blast those consarned dams!

Guide Ranger Jim around a series of levels infested
with beaver dams damming up the waters of Dynamite
Valley Park.
